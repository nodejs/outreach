## ðŸŒ³ Node.js Outreach Initiative

The **Outreach Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the Node.js community by introducing consistent workflows around avenues of community engagements like events, content, and open source contributions.

Node.js is emerging as a universal development framework and has grown to a user base of more than **10 million developers**. At the same time, Node.js users continue to report positive business impact, including improving developer productivity, satisfaction, and a lower cost. Moreover, considering the aggressive competition, the outreach team strives to publicize the work of the Node.js developers in the tech world.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

The Node.js outreach initiative is in its early stages. We are currently focused on improving community outreach workflows around the following three goals:

- [Community Events](#Community-Events)
- [Community Content](#Community-Content)
- [Community Contributions](#Community-Contributions)

### Community Events

Community events goal includes Node.js related meetups, conferences, workshops, and more. We are currently figuring out ways to promote Node speakers, events, and build consistent meetups workflow to increase participation in such events.

### Community Content

Community content goal includes everything related to writing, curating, and sharing content around Node.js.

### Community Contributions

Community contributions goal includes building resources for improving the workflow for both existing and new open source contributors to the Node.js project. Consistent contribution workflow will help attract more community contributions.
